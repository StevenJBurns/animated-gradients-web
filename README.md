One of my original simple programming ideas rewritten as an HTML web page. 

* A single web page (not SPA) built on the most basic HTML, CSS and Javascript
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [jQuery](https://jqueryui.com/) UI used to simplify color animations
* Selected styles and layout via [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons because they're awesome

There's nothing too crazy behind this project.  The approach is no different than what a novice web developer would learn in the first few weeks of an educational course.  Some features are relatively new and more "modern" :
* Layout via flexbox
* Semantic HTML5 tags
  * main
  * header
  * footer
* jQuery selectors
* Event Listeners
* Some ES6 features
  * Arrow Functions
  * Template Literals
  * Promises
